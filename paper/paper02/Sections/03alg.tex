\section{Measuring money in circulation}
\label{sec:measure}%

In \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies} monetary units are seen as ``in circulation'' for measurement day \(\perd\)
if they have been used as a medium of exchange. %
Money is referred to as circulating if it has been moved economically within the last day, month, year or generally any time period $\wndw_\perd$%
The measure is set up in a way that measurement-day \(\perd\) constitutes the last day of window \(\wndw_\perd\) for which money in circulation is to be estimated (compare figure~\ref{fig:timevars}). %
Monetary units brought into circulation in the last second of day \(\perd\) are to be attributed to belong to money in circulation for \(\perd\). %

\subsection{Intuition and original approach}
\label{sec:orig_approach}%
To estimate the subset of money supply which circulated within $\wndw$, the authors suggested to analyze the transactions recorded window $\wndw$.  %
Ignoring change, outputs of coinbase transactions and as well as transactions spending outputs generated before $\wndw$ are interpreted as bringing an amount into circulation that corresponds to the value of spent outputs.  %
All inputs referring to UTXOs generated \emph{within} period $\wndw$, on the
other hand, re-spend money which has already been counted as circulating.%
%
\textbf{[@TODO Check against illustration.]}
This can be illustrated with \reffig{mcirc_concept} where values are symbolized with coins. %
Here, we would need to determine, how many monetary units have made the transaction volume $8$ (sum of outputs in C, D, E and F excluding self-churn) during period $\wndw$ possible. %
In this example, we would need to focus on transactions A, B and D in contrast to transactions C and E which reused monetary unspent transaction outputs that have been generated within period $\wndw$. %

If change in transactions is to be considered, the general approach is complicated by a technicality of UTXO-based cryptocurrencies: Transactions always spend prior transaction outputs in full. %

The authors defined two general approaches: \ac{wba} and \ac{mca}.  %
\ac{wba} considers the sum of all inputs \textit{in circulation} (as technically all has been proven to be available for transactions) while the \ac{mca} only counts the fraction economically sent to third parties.  %
%
They are visualized in \reffig{mcirc_concept}.  %
The moved-coin approach considers only output $\mathsf{Out_1}$ of transaction $\mathsf{Tx_C}$ as circulating, not the change output.  %
This approach captures the net economic value transferred to a third party.  %
The \ac{wba} classifies the whole input of transaction $\mathsf{Tx_C}$ as circulating.  %

However, as for UTXO blockchains the relation between transaction inputs and outputs are not determined, \ac{mca} might not be defined clearly. %
If for a given transaction one input was generated within and one before $\wndw$, it remains unspecified which one corresponds to the change output.  %

The authors thus utilized assignment rule between transaction inputs and outputs utilizing the terminology of cost accounting: %
They differentiate between \ac{fifo}, where youngest inputs get assigned to outputs first, and \ac{lifo}, where it is the other way around.  %

The authors introduced three definitions of money in circulation as measured for day \(\perd\), each defined by their respective windows \(\wndw\): %
Money in circulation for period $\wndw$ adopting the \ac{wba} ($ \MCircWbPWl $), and both the \ac{mca} with the \ac{lifo} rule ($ \MCircMlPWl $) and the \ac{fifo} rule ($ \MCircMfPWl $).

\subsection{Necessity for a more efficient implementation}
\label{sec:necessity_effi}%
Applying their measure to Bitcoin data, \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies} where analyzing data for a velocity estimate based on money which has been circulating within the last day. %
Basing money in circulation on a monthly or yearly basis might provide interesting insights and was suggested by the authors as potential avenue for future research. %
The implementation suggested, however, is rather inefficient for larger time windows \(\wndw\). %

The algorithm proposed in \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies} loops over-and-over again over the same transactions as windows \(\wndw\) overlap: %
As illustrated in the conceptional description of the three velocity measures, determining whether an unspent output was spent in a given time window is essential for the chosen approach. %
While this is computationally feasible for small time windows, already for look-back windows of a few days, naively looping through all transactions is problematic. %
For daily timeseries data and multiday look-back time windows the data for computations overlaps. %
The published code on \url{https://github.com/wiberlin/ccurr_velocity} for a look-back time window of a week takes XYZ hours to terminate even if restricted on the first 3 years of the Bitcoin blockchain and run using all XY cores of a server with XY GB ram. 
\textbf{[TODO George: Here comes some O-Notation magic!]}
We thus propose an improved algorithmic implementation proceeding inductively. %

\subsection{Inaccuracy due to mistreatment of transaction fees}
\label{sec:inaccuracy_fees}%
Relying only on non-recycling transaction outputs and coinbase transactions to estimate money in circulation, the approach chosen by \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies} misrepresents fees as always in circulation. %
The reasons is that fees are captured by outputs of coinbase transactions which, when spent, are always added to the circulating money supply . %
This is a slight misrepresentation. %
Fees of transactions that have been respent in within time window \(\wndw\) ought to be considered respent as well. %
We thus, in addition to addressing the issue summarized in section \ref{sec:necessity_effi}, suggest a slight adaptation improving the estimates precision. %

\subsection{Efficiency improvements}
\label{sec:novel_impl}%

\subsubsection{Intuition}
Our approach allows for reusing and adjusting information of calculations for prior time-windows instead of recalculating them entirely for every day. %
While the novel implementation allows effectively for larger time-windows \(\wndwLength\), we reuse the general approach for measuring money in circulation proposed in \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies}. %
We do adapt it, however, by adjusting and recombining its elements. %
Our implementation steps through time by iteration periods \(\iterp\) which we chose to be 1 day each. % 
Roughly spoken, a single inductive step \(\iteri\) takes the amount of money in circulation for time window \(\wndw_\iteri\) and then: %
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shifts window \(\wndw_\iteri\) for one day (We call the new window \(\wndw_{\iteri+1}\).),
\item adds the value of monetary units drawn into circulation by the transactions of the last day of the new window \(\wndw_{\iteri+1}\), %
\item and lastly subtracts monetary units that are no longer part of the new time window. %
\end{enumerate}
To understand the inductive process in detail, its useful to first express the estimation approach introduced in Section \ref{sec:orig_approach} for individual transactions, and only then turn to the steps summarized above. %

\subsubsection{Counting coins brought into active circulation}

The aforementioned helper-structure might be seen as generalization of the estimator for money in circulation introduced in \cite{pernice2019cryptocurrencies}: %
Assume that money in circulation with a look-back time window of length \(\wndwLength\) is to be estimated for day \(\perd\). %
The helper-structure estimates how much money is been brought into active circulation during the period \([\iterp_{\Start},\iterp_{\End}]\): Before the events at day \(\iterp\), the respective money supply has remained untouched for \(\wndwLength\) days. With its transaction at day \(\iterp\), however, it can now be seen as circulating within period  \([\wndw_\Start\) to \(\wndw_\End]\). %
While the helper-structure is estimating the value of monetary units which are ``activated'' by transactions of day \( \iterp \), it does neglect outputs which turn into ``already spent'' outputs in prior days within window \(\wndw\). %
For example, in figure \ref{fig:mcirc_concept}, if we estimated the money supply for the period of iteration step \(\iterp\) we would count only money in circulation of 3 missing that transaction TX-C ``outside'' of period \(i\) activated a money supply of 2 with INP-1. %
As a consequence it only coincides with the original estimator for the special case of \(\iterp = \wndw\). %

While the original estimator requires the information of each transaction in time-window \(\wndw\), the helper-construct looks only at the transactions of iteration-step \(\iterp\) and checks their inputs age against \(\wndw_\Start\). % 

The above helper-construct can be seen as the centerpiece to realize the inductive framework. %
Algorithm \ref{algo:code_mcirc} offers a detailed summary. %

For every period $\iterp$, we loop over all transactions $t\in\TxP$ and add
their inputs to circulating money if they either reference outputs from
coinbase transactions, denoted by $\genByCoinbase(i)$, or outputs with
timestamps $\dateGen(i)$ before the first timestamp $\wndw_\Start$ of period
$\wndw$.  %
%
%  \footnote{In \reffig{mcirc_concept}, the algorithm would go trough %
%  transaction C (adding output $\mathsf{1}$ of transaction B, referenced by input $\mathsf{1}$ %
%  of transaction C), would then go to transaction D (finding no input at all), %
%  then to transaction E (skipping output $\mathsf{1}$ of transaction E but adding output $\mathsf{1}$ %
%  of transaction D as referenced by input $\mathsf{2}$ of transaction E) and so forth. %
% } %
%
%\input{Alg/alg01}



% \refalgo{code_mcirc_wb}.  %
% For every period $\wndw$, we loop over all transactions $t\in\TxW$ and add
% their inputs to circulating money if they either reference outputs from
% coinbase transactions, denoted by $\genByCoinbase(i)$, or outputs with
% timestamps $\dateGen(i)$ before the first timestamp $\wndw_\Start$ of period
% $\wndw$.  %
% %
% %  \footnote{In \reffig{mcirc_concept}, the algorithm would go trough %
% %  transaction C (adding output $\mathsf{1}$ of transaction B, referenced by input $\mathsf{1}$ %
% %  of transaction C), would then go to transaction D (finding no input at all), %
% %  then to transaction E (skipping output $\mathsf{1}$ of transaction E but adding output $\mathsf{1}$ %
% %  of transaction D as referenced by input $\mathsf{2}$ of transaction E) and so forth. %
% % } %
% %
% %\input{Alg/alg01}

% Measuring money in circulation under the \ac{mca} is depicted in
% \refalgo{code_mcirc_mc}.  %
% %
% As in \refalgo{code_mcirc_wb}, for time window $\wndw$ we loop over all
% transactions $t\in\TxP$ and add inputs based on the same core condition
% (compare lines~\ref{algo:code_mcirc_mc}-\ref{algo:code_mcirc_mcCond} and
% \ref{algo:code_mcirc_wb}-\ref{algo:code_mcirc_wbCond}).  %
% This time, however, only those inputs are regarded for further counting,
% which add up to the amount sent to third parties. Therefore, the calculated
% amount of money in circulation per transaction can be less or equal to the
% amount sent to third parties, but never more.
% The order of inputs to consider is determined by the \ac{lifo} or \ac{fifo}
% principle.  %
% For every transaction $t$ in time window $\wndw$, the amount sent to third
% parties is determined net of self-churn as
% $\valO^\sendToOthers(t) = \sum_{o\in{}\Out'_{t}} \valO(o)$ %
% where $\Out'_{t}$ denotes non-self-churn outputs of transaction $t$.  %
% If all outputs are identified as self-churn, $\valO^\sendToOthers(t) = 0$ and
% the algorithm continues with the next transaction.  %
% %
% If $\valO^\sendToOthers(t) > 0$, the algorithm collects input values in a
% vector $\InpSortedT$; they are sorted in either ascending (\ac{lifo}) or
% descending (\ac{fifo}) order \wrt to the timestamp when the UTXOs were
% generated.  %
% Then, looping over inputs $i$, input values $\valI(i)$ are added to
% $\MCircMPWl(t)$ if they meet the core condition (compare line 17) introduced
% in line 6 of \refalgo{code_mcirc_wb}.  %
% \footnote{Summands $\MCircMPWl(t)$ can be interpreted as money drawn into
%   effective circulation by transaction $t$.} %
% However, one additional condition applies: If the last added input would
% increase the summand $\MCircMPWl(t)$ beyond the value of outputs sent to
% third parties $\valO^\sendToOthers(t)$, we only add up to the latter
% amount.  %
% % This effectively adds only the necessary fraction of the inputs of
% % transaction $t$, generated before window $w$ or from coinbase transactions,
% % that were required to match $\valO^\sendToOthers(t)$.  %

%   % The components $\MCircMPWl(t)$ are consecutively summing all transaction
%   % values to calculate money in circulation $\MCircMPWl$ for the given period
%   % $p$ with respect to time window $\wndw$ as well as the applied sorting type.

% % \par While our algorithms theoretically might be applied to any window length $\wndwLength$, in practice they lack performance for large windows. %
% % Additional methods of optimization might be needed, to apply the method windows larger then 30 days. %
